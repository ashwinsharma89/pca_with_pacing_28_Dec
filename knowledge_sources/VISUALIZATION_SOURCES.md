## Dashboard Design Principles

### Layout Best Practices

   - Group related metrics

2. **White Space**
   - Don't overcrowd
   - Allow breathing room
   - Clear separation between sections

3. **Consistency**
   - Consistent color scheme
   - Uniform chart styles
   - Standard formatting

4. **Context**
   - Include comparisons (vs. previous period, vs. goal)
   - Show trends, not just current values
   - Add annotations for anomalies

### Color Usage

#### Color Schemes
- **Sequential**: Single hue, varying intensity (good for heat maps)
- **Diverging**: Two hues from center point (good for positive/negative)
- **Categorical**: Distinct colors (good for categories)

#### Best Practices
- Use brand colors consistently
- Ensure accessibility (color-blind friendly)
- Limit to 5-7 colors
- Use color purposefully (not decoratively)
- Red = negative/warning, Green = positive/success

### Interactivity

#### Interactive Elements
- **Filters**: Date range, channel, campaign
- **Drill-down**: Click to see details
- **Tooltips**: Hover for more info
- **Cross-filtering**: Select in one chart, filter others
- **Export**: Download data/images
