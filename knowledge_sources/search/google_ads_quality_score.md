# Google Ads Quality Score Optimization

## Overview
Quality Score is Google's rating of the quality and relevance of your keywords, ads, and landing pages. It directly impacts your ad rank and cost-per-click.

## Quality Score Components

### 1. Expected Click-Through Rate (CTR)
- **Weight**: ~40% of Quality Score
- **Definition**: Likelihood that your ad will be clicked when shown
- **Optimization**:
  - Write compelling, relevant ad copy
  - Include keywords in headlines
  - Use ad extensions (sitelinks, callouts, structured snippets)
  - Test multiple ad variations
  - Pause low-performing ads

### 2. Ad Relevance
- **Weight**: ~30% of Quality Score
- **Definition**: How closely your ad matches the search intent
- **Optimization**:
  - Group keywords tightly by theme
  - Create specific ad groups (5-20 keywords per group)
  - Mirror keyword language in ad copy
  - Use Dynamic Keyword Insertion (DKI) strategically
  - Ensure ad message aligns with landing page

### 3. Landing Page Experience
- **Weight**: ~30% of Quality Score
- **Definition**: How relevant and useful your landing page is
- **Optimization**:
  - Match landing page content to ad promise
  - Ensure fast page load speed (< 3 seconds)
  - Make page mobile-friendly
  - Provide clear call-to-action
  - Include relevant, original content
  - Ensure easy navigation
  - Implement HTTPS security

## Quality Score Ranges

| Score | Status | Action Required |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| 8-10  | Excellent | Maintain and scale |
| 6-7   | Good | Minor optimizations |
| 4-5   | Average | Significant improvements needed |
| 1-3   | Poor | Urgent action or pause |

## Impact on Performance

### Cost Savings
- **QS 10 vs QS 1**: Up to 50% lower CPC
- **QS 8 vs QS 5**: ~30% lower CPC
- **QS 7 vs QS 4**: ~20% lower CPC

### Ad Rank Impact
```
Ad Rank = Max CPC Bid × Quality Score
```
- Higher QS = Better ad positions at lower cost
- QS 8 with $2 bid beats QS 4 with $3 bid

## Improvement Strategies

### Quick Wins (1-2 weeks)
1. **Pause Low QS Keywords**: Remove keywords with QS < 4
2. **Add Negative Keywords**: Reduce irrelevant impressions
3. **Improve Ad Copy**: Add keywords to headlines
4. **Enable Ad Extensions**: Increase CTR by 10-15%

### Medium-Term (1-2 months)
1. **Restructure Ad Groups**: Create tighter keyword themes
2. **A/B Test Landing Pages**: Improve conversion rates
3. **Optimize Page Speed**: Target < 2 second load time
4. **Refine Match Types**: Shift from broad to phrase/exact

### Long-Term (3+ months)
1. **Build Landing Page Library**: Dedicated pages per theme
2. **Implement Dynamic Landing Pages**: Personalize by keyword
3. **Continuous Testing**: Always have 2-3 ad variations running
4. **Monitor Competitor Changes**: Adapt to market shifts

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Single Keyword Ad Groups (SKAGs) Overuse**: Can limit reach
2. **Ignoring Mobile Experience**: 60%+ of searches are mobile
3. **Generic Landing Pages**: Must match ad specificity
4. **Neglecting Negative Keywords**: Wastes budget on irrelevant clicks
5. **Not Testing Ad Copy**: Stagnant ads lose CTR over time

## Quality Score Myths

❌ **Myth**: Pausing low QS keywords hurts account
✅ **Reality**: Pausing improves overall account health

❌ **Myth**: QS is calculated at account level
✅ **Reality**: QS is keyword-level, but account history matters

❌ **Myth**: Increasing bids improves QS
✅ **Reality**: Bids don't directly affect QS, but can increase data for optimization

## Monitoring & Reporting

### Key Metrics to Track
- Average Quality Score by campaign/ad group
- QS distribution (% of keywords in each range)
- QS trend over time
- Correlation between QS and conversion rate
- Cost savings from QS improvements

### Reporting Frequency
- **Daily**: Monitor QS for new keywords
- **Weekly**: Review QS changes and trends
- **Monthly**: Comprehensive QS audit and optimization plan

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Quality Score Inheritance
- New keywords inherit QS from account history
- Build strong account foundation before scaling

### 2. Historical Performance
- Google considers long-term keyword performance
- Be patient with new keywords (30-90 days)

### 3. Cross-Device Impact
- Mobile QS affects desktop and vice versa
- Optimize for all devices

### 4. Competitive Benchmarking
- Compare your QS to industry averages
- Search: 6-7 average
- Display: 5-6 average
