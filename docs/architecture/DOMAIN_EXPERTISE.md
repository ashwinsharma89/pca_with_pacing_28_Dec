## 💡 Example Analysis Output

### Funnel Insight:
```
"Your funnel shows strong awareness (12M impressions) but weak 
consideration (1.2% CTR vs 2.0% benchmark). This indicates creative 
or targeting issues. Recommendation: Test new ad creative with 
stronger value propositions and refine audience targeting to 
in-market segments."
```

### ROAS Insight:
```
"Google Ads achieving 4.5x ROAS, exceeding 4.0x benchmark by 12.5%. 
This is your most efficient channel with $92K spend generating $414K 
revenue. Recommendation: Scale Google Ads budget by 50% ($46K increase) 
to capture additional high-intent traffic while maintaining efficiency."
```

### Audience Insight:
```
"No audience segmentation data detected. Adding demographic and 
interest data would enable deeper analysis. Based on platform mix, 
recommend: (1) Google Ads: In-Market audiences for bottom-funnel, 
(2) Meta: Lookalike audiences from top converters, (3) LinkedIn: 
Director+ level targeting for B2B."
```

### Tactics Insight:
```
"CPA variance of $18 (35% of average) suggests bidding inconsistency.
